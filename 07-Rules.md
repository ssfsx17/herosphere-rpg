# Rules

## Long Rests

A Long Rest is defined as "long enough for a potential consequence." This has historically been defined as 8 hours of sitting still, but is more abstract in Hero Sphere RPG.

Potential consequences include:

- Random enemies may discover you and lay siege to you.
- It may take too long to make it to another location in time.
- The trail may grow cold.
- Taskmasters may think less of you, just because you took proper care of yourself.
- Less-seasoned companions may grow desperate and act out.

The consequences could be determined by a Dramatic Chance roll.

Long Rests fully restore Health and Energy.

## Dramatic Scenes

Dramatic Chance - Roll for percentile.
- 01 to 10 - Everyone loses 1 health and energy
- 11 to 30 - You lose 1 health and energy
- 31 to 70 - No rules effects. Described as ordinary progress through a scene, or balanced combat effect.
- 71 to 90 - You regain 1 health and energy
- 91 to 100 - Everyone regains 1 health and energy

Resources can be used, but only once per scene. And there may be multiple Dramatic Chances in one scene.

You can spend extra time to adjust your Dramatic Chance roll upwards by 10, but this will cause the next Dramatic Chance roll to be adjusted downwards by 10.

### Rotating Dramatic Centers

For each Dramatic Scene, a different character is the center of the scene. This should be done in a round-robin rotation to guarantee that every character gets an equal number of scenes as the center. The central character can choose to adjust one Dramatic Chance by up to 20. This adjustment can only be done once per scene. It represents all of the expertise, history, drama, skill, prowess, etc. of that character being used in a single moment.

## Combat

### Order Phase

Each combatant rolls for percentile. They go in order from highest to lowest result, with "00 0" representing 100.

### Action Phase

Each combatant gets exactly four actions. Actions can be any of the following:
- Attack
- Charge Energy
- Expend Resource
- Move
- Perform Technique
- Rest

#### Attack

The attacker spends from their Accuracy and Damage pools to commit an attack. The Accuracy expenditure decreases the target's Evasion pool. If the target is at 0 Evasion, then the Damage is applied against the target's Armor pool. If the target is at 0 Armor, then remaining Damage is applied to the target's Health.

When a combatant is at 0 Health, they become Defeated.

Note that surplus Accuracy and overkill Damage normally do nothing. But, some Sphere Powers may be able to do something with them.

#### Charge Energy

The Charge Energy action restores 1 energy to yourself.

Each subsequent round that it is maintained will restore an amount equal to the previous round's charge, plus 1 more energy in the current round. For example, on the 3rd round of performing Charge Energy, 3 energy is restored.

#### Expend Resource

Each Resource can only be used once per combat or scene.

#### Move

The Move action moves you by up to 30 feet.

#### Perform Technique

Most techniques require expenditure of Energy. If not, then they require the expenditure of something else, such as Elemental Charge.

Each technique can only have an element applied once.

Many techniques are specified to be a special form of Attack.

#### Rest

The Rest action removes one status condition of choice from yourself.

### Status Phase

Accuracy, Armor, Damage, and Evasion are fully restored. Then, bonuses, penalties, and status conditions are applied.

#### Status Conditions

Helpful Status Conditions

- Regeneration - Restore 1 Health during the status phase. Once the Health is restored, this status is removed.
- Thorns - Apply 1 Damage to the next enemy who does a Melee Attack at you. Once the damage is applied, this status is removed.

Negative Status Conditions

- Bleed - 1 Damage is applied to you during the Status Phase, unless you spend an action to hold yourself.
- Blind - -2 Accuracy
- Buried - -1 Accuracy and Evasion
- Burn - 1 Damage is applied to you during the Status Phase, unless you spend an action to roll around on the ground.
- Chilled - -2 Armor
- Confuse - You lose 1 Energy during the Status Phase, unless you spend an action to concentrate.
- Pin - -2 Evasion
- Poison - 1 Damage is applied to you during the Status Phase, unless you spend an action to hold still and squeeze the poison out.
- Shocked - -1 Armor and Evasion
- Stun - -1 Accuracy and Damage

### Terrain and Cover

Cover grants a bonus of 1 Armor and 1 Evasion.
