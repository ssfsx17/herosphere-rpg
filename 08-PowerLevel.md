# Power Level

After each game session, you gain one Power Level.

All Power Levels must be bound to one of your Ideals. Therefore, you should maintain a journal of Power Levels, their associated Ideals, and the choices made with each of the Power Levels.

Each Power Level grants one of the following choices:

- +2 to Maximum Health
- +1 to Maximum Energy
- +1 to Accuracy
- +1 to Armor
- +1 to Damage
- +1 to Evasion

Every 3 Power Levels grants one of the following choices, starting at Power Level 3:

- 1 new Element Sphere learned
- 1 new Technique Sphere learned
- 1 new Resource Sphere learned

Every 5 Power Levels grants one additional maximum Key Sphere, starting at Power Level 5.
