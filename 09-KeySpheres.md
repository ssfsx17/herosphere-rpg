# Key Spheres

Key Spheres can be activated and deactivated whenever you are not in a Dramatic Scene or Combat. Your maximum number of Key Spheres active at a time is equal to your Power Level divided by 5, rounded down. This means you need a Power Level of at least 5 to have a Key Sphere active.

Berserk

- You can spend 5 Accuracy to add 2 damage to an attack, against a target whose Evasion is already depleted.
- You get one Blind, Stun, and Unlucky status when your Evasion is depleted.

Counterattack

- When one enemy's Accuracy is depleted, you get one instant free attack or technique against that one enemy.
- You cannot spend more than half your maximum Accuracy in one action, rounded down.

Defensive Wall

- Your Evasion is converted to Armor.
- You are considered to be hit by depletion of Evasion at the beginning of every round. This could be a problem if you also have something like Berserk active.
